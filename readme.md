# Vanilla Coding _PHP Framework_

If you love _Vanilla Coding in PHP_, then this basic framework could be good for you.

- Check the php server settings in `.site/php.ini`, if they are right for you (skip, if you are unsure)
- Check the apache server settings in `.site/httpd.conf`, if they are right for you  (skip, if you are unsure)
- Then, start `xampp-create-vhost.bat` with Admin to install your site on your local XAMPP webserver.
- Check the _hello world_ of the installed web app in your browser (the default URL is _https://dev.appfoldername_).

**Start Writing your Code in Visual Studio Code, just by double-clicking on `vscode.code-workspace` and test your site in your browser.**

> If you are **a total newbie** in local PHP development, you can download and install the `PHP Coding Setup for Windows`. This tool helps you to
> setup your machine with all the tools that you need for a smooth development experience:
>
> - Visual Studio Code incl. GITHUB Copilot (great for being productive in writing code)
> - TurtoiseGIT (to clone this repository to your local machine)
> - WinMerge (will be valuable, if you have to compare the content of two different files)
> - XAMPP (to run and to test your web app locally on Windows in your browser)
